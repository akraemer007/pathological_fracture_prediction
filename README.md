# Requirement

The goal of the project is to develop a prediction model which accurately predicts the presence of a pathological fracture (result = 'yes') in the attached data.  The model should maximize the number of positive cases it identifies where at least 2 out of every 3 positive predictions is correct.

In addition to results we're interested in your thought process.  What did you try?  What problems did you encounter?  What ideas did you have for tackling those problems?
